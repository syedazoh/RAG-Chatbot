Skincare Knowledge Base: Core Principles & Routines
1. Determining Skin Types
To provide accurate advice, identify the user's skin type first:

Oily Skin: Appears shiny, has enlarged pores, and is prone to breakouts or blackheads.

Dry Skin: Feels tight, may have flaky patches, and looks dull or rough.

Combination Skin: Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) but dry or normal on the cheeks.

Sensitive Skin: Prone to redness, itching, burning, or dryness in response to products or environment.

Normal Skin: Balanced moisture, small pores, and few imperfections.

2. The Essential Morning Routine (AM)
The goal of the morning routine is protection.

Cleanser: Use a gentle cleanser or just water to remove nighttime sweat and oil.

Toner (Optional): Helps balance skin pH or provide a light layer of hydration.

Serum (Optional): Use antioxidants like Vitamin C to protect against pollution and UV damage.

Moisturizer: Seals in hydration. Even oily skin needs a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer.

Sunscreen (Crucial): Apply broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher every day, even indoors or when it is cloudy.

3. The Essential Evening Routine (PM)
The goal of the evening routine is repair.

Double Cleanse: Use an oil-based cleanser first to remove SPF and makeup, followed by a water-based cleanser.

Exfoliation (1-3x a week): Use chemical exfoliants (AHA for dry skin, BHA/Salicylic Acid for oily/acne-prone skin).

Treatment/Serums: Apply active ingredients like Retinol (for aging/acne), Niacinamide (for pores/texture), or Hyaluronic Acid (for hydration).

Moisturizer/Night Cream: A thicker cream to support the skin barrier while sleeping.

4. Key Ingredients & Their Benefits
Hyaluronic Acid: A humectant that pulls moisture into the skin. Best for all skin types, especially dry.

Salicylic Acid (BHA): Oil-soluble acid that clears pores. Best for acne and oily skin.

Retinoids (Retinol): Increases cell turnover. Best for fine lines, wrinkles, and acne. Note: Use only at night and always wear SPF the next day.

Vitamin C: Brightens skin tone and protects against environmental damage.

Niacinamide (Vitamin B3): Minimizes pore appearance, regulates oil, and strengthens the skin barrier.

Ceramides: Lipids that help repair the skin’s natural barrier and retain moisture.

5. Specific Skin Concerns
Acne: Look for Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid. Avoid heavy oils and "comedogenic" ingredients.

Hyperpigmentation/Dark Spots: Use Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Kojic Acid, or Azelaic Acid.

Aging: Focus on Retinoids, Peptides, and consistent Sunscreen usage.

Dehydration: Use Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin; drink plenty of water.

6. Lifestyle & Safety Tips
Patch Testing: Always test a new product on a small area of skin (like the inner arm) for 24 hours before full application.

Patience: Most skincare products take 4–6 weeks of consistent use to show visible results.

Hydration & Diet: Internal health reflects on the skin. A balanced diet and adequate water intake are essential.

Professional Advice: If the user has severe cystic acne, persistent rashes, or changing moles, advise them to consult a board-certified dermatologist.
